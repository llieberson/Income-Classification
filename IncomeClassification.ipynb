However, it is important to note that the assumption that the independent and dependent variables are linearly separable is a large one to make. Regardless, it outperformed Naive Bayes and does not require scaling since it is not distance based."

Luckily enough, this model outperformed the others on all metrics. To take it a step further, I built a random forest using a bagging method in order to further increase the reliability of my results and prevent overfitting. I noticed in the notes file that tree methods had error rates below 5%, which is a lot smaller than Naive-Bayes. With boosting, the error decreases even further. In this exercise, I was curious to see whether the same applied to bagging, which seems to be true given that precision and recall improved."
